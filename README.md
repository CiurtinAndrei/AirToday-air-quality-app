AirToday is an application focused on delivering accurate and comprehensive air quality information for various urban environments in Romania. It was developed using Next.js and Typescript with air quality data retrieved from the open-source API provided by the WAQI (World Air Quality Index) project.
This application offers a wide range of air quality metrics such as humidity, temperature and the quantities of various pollutants, along with the ability of showing the pollution forecast for each of the main pollutants in the coming days.
AirToday is entirely in Romanian, but there are plans to translate it into English as an alternative for non-Romanian speakers that want access to air quality data from Romania.
